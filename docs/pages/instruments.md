<!-- Writing this is really making me reconsider the utility of having this page at all -->

The Instruments page of Run Scanner can be accessed by clicking the 'Instruments' link on the header bar of the Run Scanner interface. This page lists the sequencing output directories defined in the configuration JSON. (For more information, please refer to <a href="installation.html#setup">Setting Up Run Scanner</a>) 

Please note that this page will list sequencing output directories regardless of if Run Scanner can meaningfully access them. This information can be found in the <a href="main.html#sequencers">Sequencing Output Directories sections of the Main page</a>.
