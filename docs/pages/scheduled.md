The Scheduled page of Run Scanner can be accessed by clicking the 'Scheduled' link on the header bar of the Run Scanner interface. This page outlines the runs which have been detected by Run Scanner but have not yet been processed. Items will be removed from the list and into <a href="processing.html">Processing</a> and then <a href="scanned.html">Scanned</a> as they are successfully processed by Run Scanner.

Each item in the list contains the Run Alias of the detected run, and the path at which the run was found.

For more information on the distinction between scanning (detection) and processing, please refer to <a href="internal.html">Internal Operation</a>.
