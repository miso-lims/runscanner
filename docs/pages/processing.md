The Processing page of Run Scanner can be accessed by clicking the 
'Processing' link on the header bar of the Run Scanner interface. This page 
outlines the runs which have been detected by Run Scanner and are currently 
being processed by Run Scanner. Items will be removed from the list and into 
<a href="scanned.html">Scanned</a> as they are successfully processed.

Each item in the list contains the Run Alias of the detected run, and the 
path at which the run was found.
